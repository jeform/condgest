To run this sample application you need to import our sample
database schema into your local MySQL.

To do this simply write:

# mysqladmin create p4a_products_catalogue
# mysql p4a_products_catalogue < db_dump_mysql.sql

Now you can open your browser to:

http://localhost/p4a/applications/products_catalogue

Have fun!
